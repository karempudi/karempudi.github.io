I am soon to graduate PhD student from [Johan Elf](https://elflab.icm.uu.se) group. I worked on many areas during my PhD ranging from microscopy and microfluidics to AI/ML applications for high-throuput data analysis. In a former life I used to be a fabrication process engineer working with most of the standard techniques found in academic clean-rooms, but for the past 3-4 years I mostly write code in Python and some C++.

This is my [blog](/blog), where I write notes about the things I am figuring out and document some ideas. I am not going to be at the university for long and this will be hosting space for all the fun things I am interested in. These days I am mostly studying [`how to make neural networks run really fast`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFvPEQTxKI&list=PL80kAHvQbh-pT4lCkDT53zT8DKmhE0idB) , [`learning CUDA to do more efficient operations on GPUs`](https://a.co/d/27otEFR), and [`some 3D modeling work as I am playing with VR googles`]().
